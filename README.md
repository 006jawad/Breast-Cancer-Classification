# Breast-Cancer-Classification

This miniaturized web application is an implementation of our paper [Breast Cancer Classification Using Ensemble of Machine Learning Boosting Algorithms](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9850750). The automation of the Breast Cancer detection framework has been accomplished in this article. Several ML algorithms and different preprocessing were utilized throughout the article for the complete ablation studies. With the help of the Outlier Rejection and Attibute Selection methods, the performance of the ML models is enhanced in the suggested Breast Cancer detection pipeline. The reasonable selection of attributes improves the overall outcomes. The suggested weighted ensemble models ensure that they are outstanding for the Breast Cancer detection task for the utilized dataset corresponding
to other single ML models. In the end, we have developed this toy web application for Breast Cancer detection, deploying our trained weights. In the future, we will investigate the computational complexity of our proposed framework in real-time Breast Cancer applications. The interface of the current application design will be improved, considering more clinical settings.
